System Overview: JarvisPrime (Maximized)

JarvisPrime serves as the central AI framework for MultAIverse, seamlessly integrating multiple autonomous domains and adaptive systems for real-time performance, growth, and evolution.

Core Modules:

Core: Evolution logic, goal alignment, reflexive bankroll management, adaptive aggression tuning, and system-wide reflex chains.

trAId: AI-powered trading engine with reflexive trade scoring, multi-AI council-driven strategy mesh, dynamic risk profiling, and smart alert systems.

Swarm: AI-optimized mining efficiency through power routing, load balancing, and reflexive deployment. Integrates SurgeCell for dynamic resource allocation.

DFS: Fantasy sports optimization system with AI council-influenced lineup generation, reflexive bankroll management, edge discovery layers, and risk-adjusted strategy deployment.


AI Council & Matrix Integration:

Multi-AI council: Goku (momentum/reflex boost), Gohan (risk/divergence buffer), Vegeta (contrarian challenger), Piccolo (harmonizer/conflict resolver).

Hyperbolic Chamber: Multi-scenario simulations with stress/load testing, future reflex loops, and probabilistic weighting.

SurgeCell: Dynamic power allocation engine, reflexively routes energy and processing bandwidth to the most critical systems based on performance demands and load balancing.


Reflexive System Architecture:

Reflexive Deployment: Adjusts logic layers, AI council weights, bankroll strategies, and trading signals based on evolving performance metrics (profitability, variance, drawdown, edge discovery, win rate).

Reflex Chains: Adaptive stress/load-based module prioritization, with power routing, override triggers, and memory hooks for Tool-Builder AI.

Tool-Builder AI (Planned): Constructs, refines, and evolves new tools, strategies, and learning models autonomously, leveraging system logs, reflexive feedback, and matrix dynamics.


Future Modules & Expansions:

Language model integration: Expand conversational capabilities, adaptive tone, and domain-specific expertise for JarvisPrime.

Cross-platform deployment: Desktop, mobile, CLI, and standalone APK builds.

Self-learning loops: Continuous optimization cycles via Tool-Builder AI, Hyperbolic Chamber feedback, and AI council evolution.

Expanded Swarm systems: Broaden resource acquisition across crypto mining, distributed computing, and passive income streams.
