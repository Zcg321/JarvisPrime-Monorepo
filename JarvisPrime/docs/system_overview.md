Edge Discovery Layers: Identifies and leverages hidden opportunities or undervalued players through advanced statistical analysis.

Risk-Adjusted Strategy Deployment: Allocates resources dynamically, adjusting strategy based on player performance and contest type (GPP, Cash, Satellite).

AI Council & Matrix Integration:
Multi-AI Council:
Goku: Momentum boost and reflex compression. Aggressively adapts strategies based on rapid market changes.

Gohan: Risk buffer and divergence detection. Safeguards the system against high volatility and extreme outcomes.

Vegeta: Contrarian logic, constantly challenges the status quo to find overlooked opportunities.

Piccolo: Harmonizes conflicting strategies, ensuring the overall system remains stable and balanced.

Hyperbolic Chamber:
Multi-Scenario Simulations: Runs scenarios based on varying conditions and stress tests to ensure optimal decision-making.

Stress/Load Testing: Continuously evaluates system performance, ensuring that logic remains effective under pressure.

Probabilistic Weighting: Applies dynamic probability weights to future scenarios based on past performance and feedback.

SurgeCell:
Dynamic Power Allocation: Routes processing power dynamically, ensuring the system adapts in real time to evolving demands.

Adaptive Performance-Based Routing: Increases power to underperforming systems or critical tasks when needed, optimizing overall system performance.

Reflexive System Architecture:

Adjusts Logic Layers: Dynamically changes logic paths and processing weights based on ongoing performance metrics.

AI Council Weights: Tweaks the influence of each council member (Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo) based on performance outcomes and user goals.

Bankroll Strategies: Adapts bankroll management techniques depending on market or contest conditions.

Trading Signals: Alters trade signal thresholds dynamically, ensuring that alerts are always in sync with current market conditions.

Reflex Chains:
Stress/Load-Based Module Prioritization: Allocates resources dynamically based on system stress, overriding lower-priority tasks to ensure critical systems are prioritized.

Power Routing: Adjusts power distribution based on logic needs, ensuring high-priority modules get the necessary resources.

Override Triggers: Automatically triggers overrides when certain thresholds (e.g., stress, risk, performance) are met.

Tool-Builder AI:
Self-Refining Tools: Continuously creates new tools, strategies, and learning models based on system logs, feedback loops, and matrix performance.

Tool/Strategy Generation: Combines various logic layers from the AI council and other subsystems to generate novel strategies and tools for continuous optimization.

Future Modules & Expansions:
Language Model Integration: Expanding JarvisPrime's conversational abilities, making it more responsive to real-time inputs with adaptive tone and domain-specific expertise.

Cross-Platform Deployment: Expanding the system to be deployable across multiple platforms: desktop, mobile, and standalone APK.

Self-Learning Loops: Enabling continuous system evolution through recursive feedback loops, Hyperbolic Chamber evaluations, and council evolution.

Expanded Swarm Systems: Broadening the Swarm AI to optimize resource acquisition in other areas like crypto mining, distributed computing, and passive income generation.

Cross-Domain Strategy Expansion: Integrating additional domains (e.g., portfolio management, sports betting) into the existing framework, ensuring seamless interaction and logic consistency across all tasks.

System Evolution:
This document and the JarvisPrime system itself are designed to evolve as new capabilities are added and as the core functionalities are refined. JarvisPrime will continue to maximize its efficiency and power through feedback loops, reflexive systems, and multi-AI council-driven logic, ensuring that all integrated domains — whether it's trading, mining, DFS optimization, or strategic modeling — remain at the cutting edge of performance.
