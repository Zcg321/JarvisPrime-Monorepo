# JarvisPrime

Core continuity anchors are stored in `core/jarvisprime`:

- `continuum_master_final.json`
- `continuum_ascension_path.json`
- `JarvisPrime_BootProtocol.md`
- `continuum_true_endgame.json`

These files preserve project continuity and should remain present in the repository.

## Alchohalt

A minimal Python port of the planned **Alchohalt** tracker is available under
`alchohalt/`.  It records daily check-ins, calculates streaks, and prints a
humanâ€‘readable reminder schedule.  Run the test suite with `pytest` to verify
its behaviour.
